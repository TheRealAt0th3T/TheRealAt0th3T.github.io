## Topic: Video Games, mental health, and cancer treatments

2. With the pandemic hitting the world hard, it is heavily affecting society’s mental health, with people having turned to online communications and activities to try and stay connected to the world. Prior to the pandemic, a lot of people were blaming the gaming industry for a rise in violence. I want to research and discuss how that is wrong and that there are many applications, such as mental health, where using this technology can be greatly beneficial. 

3. I want to cover partly as to why video games don’t create violence and then immediately go into all the benefits. I want to cover mainly mental health, but also dabble a bit into cancer treatments and management. I know a few years back, they were just releasing games that they made specifically for cancer patients to use, and I would love to write about the updates that are out now. 

4. I chose this topic because I am a double major studying computer science and game development (GIMM), so the gaming industry is really where I am aiming to be in the future. I also remember talking to Professor Winiecki about this topic when I took an ethics course with him. This area has always fascinated me, and I believe the world as a whole is looking at gaming in a more positive light. I truly do think many kids used it as a relief to get away from the stresses of the pandemic, almost using playing games as a selfcare tactic. I would love to be able to fully read up on research and really know the facts as to what the world’s views are.
